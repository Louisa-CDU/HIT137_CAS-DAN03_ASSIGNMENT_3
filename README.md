## Project Components
^^ Question 1: Image Processing Desktop Application
A Python-based GUI application using **Tkinter** and **OpenCV** that allows users to:
- Load and display images from their local device
- Crop images via mouse interaction with real-time visual feedback
- Resize cropped images using a slider (with live preview)
- Save the modified image
- *(Optional features implemented as time permitted: keyboard shortcuts, undo/redo, etc.)*

^^ Question 2: 2D Side-Scrolling Game
A game built with **Pygame** featuring:
- A playable character that can run, jump, and shoot projectiles
- Enemies and collectible items across 3 unique levels
- A scoring system based on defeated enemies and collected items
- Health bars, lives, and a game-over screen with restart option
- *(Optional enhancements: dynamic camera, audio effects, boss battles)*
